plan:

components so far:
ranging module - DWM1000
MCU - STM32F411
IMU - LSM6DSRTR
Battery charge IC - TP4056
Batteries - undecided

update frequencies:
IMU data - 1000hz
ranging data refresh - 100hz
ranging module - 1000hz

kalman filter on ranging data, 10 samples per refresh (refresh is update IMU offset at 100hz)
kalman also factor accel data from IMU for sanity check

where processing?
all prototype boards are the same and can all be either tag/anchor
tag would mean only data out would be final location
anchor would mean lower power consumption on tag

yaw?
could use magnetometer but sensitive to magnetic envirment
multiple dw1000 modules and use trigonometry to get angle (increases cost per tracker)

all data transfer is to an anchor which is plugged into pc with usb cable

trilateration to get x,y,z posisiton from ranging

pitch/roll/yaw from gyro (with 3 dw1000 modules too?)

accuracy (quoted from dw1000 datasheet): +-5cm
std dev: 2cm ish
